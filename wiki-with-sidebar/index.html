                        <b>T'Challa</b> a.k.a. <b>the Black Panther</b> 
                        was the Head of state of the African nation of Wakanda, 
                        the most technologically advanced country on Earth. In 
                        this role, he was the King/Chieftain, religious leader, 
                        and commander-in-chief all rolled into one.[29] He is 
                        also considered among the top intellects in the world. 
                        Using Wakanda's advanced Vibranium technology and his 
                        own abilities and fortune, he pledged his life to the 
                        service of all humankind.[31] He would go on to become 
                        a prominent member of the Avengers,[32] and eventually 
                        become leader of the team.[33] While recent revelations 
                        about his time as Wakanda's ruler would strain his 
                        relationship with both his subjects and his fellow 
                        heroes, ultimately leading to his exile from the 
                        country,[34] he remains an Avenger[35] and a stalwart 
                        protector of his people.

                    <p>
                        T'Challa was the first biological son of T'Chaka, 
                        king of the African nation of Wakanda, a secluded 
                        technologically advanced country that contained the 
                        only source of the rare ultra-durable metal known 
                        as Vibranium. His mother, N'Yami, died a week after 
                        giving birth to her son as a consequence of a rare 
                        autoimmune disease she had contracted during 
                        pregnancy.[37] T'Challa's adopted older brother, 
                        Hunter, blamed him for her death.[38]

                    <p>
                        As a young man, T'Challa traveled to America and Europe 
                        to attend universities. B'Tumba, his childhood friend, 
                        was sent by his father N'Baza to study alongside him. 
                        While in the US, T'Challa used the alias "Luke Charles" 
                        to remain incognito. It was during this time that he met 
                        another student Nicole Adams and the two had a short 
                        romance.[16][43][44] Another student, Kamal Rakim, 
                        was angered that T'Challa was dating a white person 
                        and attacked the two. T'Challa was forced to defend 
                        himself and Nicole, easily taking down Kamal and his 
                        gang.[45] A similar incident would come up while 
                        meeting his future ally & fellow hero who o
                        riginally went by Carl Lucas. The two would get into a
                         brief fight as the latter & his gangbanger buddies 
                         tried to rob him, ending when Lucas didn't like how 
                         T'Challa used a falsie alias, but took interest in 
                         the name 'Luke' irregardless. The former ruffian 
                         relenting as they exchanged good advice between 
                         themselves but refusing to shake Luke's hand when the 
                         college boy offered it in friendship.[44] He gained a 
                         Ph.D. in Physics from Oxford University.[31] 
                         Being bested at every sport and every endeavor, 
                         B'Tumba grew jealous and turned to A.I.M., 
                         plotting revenge against T'Chaka's son.

                    <p>
                        T'Challa came back to perform his duties in his tribe to 
                        become a man to lead the country. He was sent to find 
                        the sacred Heart-Shaped Herb, whilst searching he was 
                        captured by A.I.M., B'Tumba was ordered to execute his 
                        friend, but since he couldn't do it, he freed T'Challa 
                        and joined him in battling the A.I.M. soldiers. During 
                        the combat, B'Tumba was fatally wounded, and after 
                        A.I.M. retreated, he apologized to Black Panther 
                        before dying.[43]
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Two years before it was expected, T'Challa anonymously 
                        challenged his uncle S'Yan for the throne,[46] and 
                        upon victory gained the mantle of the Black Panther 
                        from him. S'Yan happily stepped down, so his nephew 
                        could rule.[47] T'Challa then took a Heart-Shaped 
                        Herb to link himself to Bast, the Panther God. 
                        The herb also enhanced the new king, making him 
                        almost superhuman.

                        While developing nuclear weaponry inside Wakanda, 
                        he began to invite super-powered people to his country, 
                        beginning with the Fantastic Four.[2] Although, once he 
                        found out what kind of people they were, T'Challa saw 
                        them as allies as well as friends. They helped T'Challa 
                        defeat Klaw without taking his life.[49] In thanks, he 
                        played baseball with his new American friends.[50] 
                        T'Challa later sent a missile from Wakanda to the 
                        Baxter Building, piercing the barrier. Inside, 
                        Reed removed the vibranium bands which he had radioed 
                        the Black Panther to send to him. Reed then used them 
                        to beat Klaw into submission. After the battle, Reed 
                        radioed T'Challa to thank him for helping them out.
                        [51] T'Challa witnessed Doctor Doom travel the globe 
                        with the Silver Surfer's stolen cosmic power

                        Black Panther, under the identity of "Luke Charles", 
                        teamed up with Captain America to battle Baron Zemo.
                        [1] After defeating him Cap asked Black Panther to 
                        join the Avengers.[18]

                        With the team he battled the Grim Reaper,[32] the 
                        Brotherhood of Evil Mutants,[54] the Masters of
                         Evil[55] led by Ultron-5,[56] Scarlet Centurion,
                         [57] he even time traveled back to World War II,[58] 
                         he helped take down the Vision, Ultron's latest 
                         creation,[59] who later joined the team.[60] He 
                         fought also Yellowjacket,[61] the Circus of Crime,
                         [62] and Surtur with Ymir
