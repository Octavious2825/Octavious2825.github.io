            The viral Kanafeh-inspired Chocolate Bar from a dessert spot called The 
            Fix in Dubai has been going viral and since lots of us are a plane ride 
            away, we're going to make it at home and even better! Oozing with 
            pistachio butter and crispy toasted shredded phyllo bits, this 
            chocolate is the definition of indulgence. Every single bite is so 
            creamy but also so crispy at the same time and the taste is so 
            reminiscent of everyone's favorite Arab dessert!

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup pistachio paste/butter</li>
            <li>1 to 1/2 cup shredded phyllo or kataifi, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <li>2 to 3 cups milk chocolate, melted</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white chocolate, melted</li>
    
        <h2>INSRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan to 350Â°F.</li>
        <li>
            Add the shredded phyllo in and fry until golden and crispy. 
            If frying another batch, use a slotted spoon to take out the 
            fried phyllo.Transfer to a plate with a paper towel to 
            drain excess oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are not frying another batch, it'll be easier to set up a bowl 
            with a strainer and pour the pan over to let the oil drain and the 
             strainer catch the phyllo.
         </li>
        <li>Allow the fried phyllo to cool down for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the pistachio paste to a mixing bowl along with the fried phyllo 
        and mix together to combine.
        </li>
        <li> OPTIONAL: To the chocolate mold, add a light drizzle of 
        white chocolate
        </li>
        <li>
            Then add in about 1/4 cup or more of melted milk chocolate and shake it 
            around to cover the bottom and sides completely.
        </li>
        <li>Pop in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes until hard.</li>
        <li>
            Take the mold out and fill the chocolate mold with the pistachio and 
            phyllo mixture almost all the way to the top
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the filling entirely with more melted chocolate and pop it back 
            in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes until hard.
        </li>
        <li>Once set, pop out of the mold and enjoy!</li>
