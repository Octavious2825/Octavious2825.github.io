                <p>
                    Spanning two console generations and thousands of game 
                    releases, the twenty-teens have been incredible for both 
                    game developers and their fans alike. While we thought 
                    about putting together a definitive ranking of the best 
                    games that came out between 2010 and the end of 2019, it 
                    quickly became apparent that there were way too many 
                    awesome games to crown just one as the decade’s best. 
                    To that end, here are - with no particular ranking - our 
                    favorite games of the last ten years.
                </p>
                <h2 id="2010">Fallout New Vegas (2010)</h2>
                <p>
                    All of the Fallout games are great, but New Vegas stands 
                    above the rest thanks to the depth of its characters, its 
                    dark sense of humor, and the flexibility of its story.
                </p>
                <img 
                    src="images/new vegas.jpg" 
                    alt="New vegas"
                >
                <p>
                    Several factions with deep, shades-of-gray characters 
                    populate the wastes with interesting moral decisions, 
                    making the conflict between the New California Republic, 
                    Caesar’s Legion, and the mysterious Mr. House feel like 
                    anything but a black-and-white choice between good and evil. 
                    The fact that we get to decide the outcome makes it even 
                    better.

                <h2 id="2011">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011)</h2>
                <p>
                    There's a good reason why Skyrim has been ported to 
                    everything – even Amazon Alexa: it's fantastic. It is the 
                    quintessential open-world fantasy role-playing game. That 
                    it was released in 2011 and still hasn't been surpassed in 
                    its genre here at the end of the decade should give you a 
                    good idea of how high it set the bar. Sure, it birthed many 
                    a meme and suffered many a glitch, but look at the game 
                    proper and you'll quickly remember why you fell in love 
                    with it.
                </p>
                <h2 id="2012">Telltale's The Walking Dead: Season 1 (2012)</h2>
                <p>
                    Adventure games are hardly new, but Telltale's twist on 
                    them certainly was. In stripping away almost everything 
                    but the dialogue and dialogue choices, the studio was able 
                    to let the story become the single most important thing in 
                    the game, and they never did it better than in their first 
                    season of The Walking Dead.
                </p>
                <h2 id="2013">Grand Theif Auto 5 (2013)</h2>
                <img 
                    src="images/gta v.avif" 
                    alt="GTA V">
                <p>
                    Everything in GTA V was leaps and bounds ahead of previous 
                    entries visually, technically, tonally, and stylistically. 
                    The decision to move between three drastically different 
                    protagonists, essentially giving the story its own id, ego, 
                    and superego (or at the very least, three monkeys trying to 
                    avoid seeing, hearing, or speaking any evil) was more than 
                    just a novel way of adding variety, it helped keep even the 
                    most absurd and game-ey activities grounded against its 
                    pitch-perfect sendup of 21st-century southern California.

                <h2 id="2014">Five Nights at Freddy's (2014)</h2>
                <p>
                    Though Five Nights at Freddy’s is mostly known today as a 
                    cult phenomenon that helped launch a million YouTube 
                    careers, the first game remains a tightly-wound little 
                    horror machine, able to evoke scares through simple, 
                    brutally effective mechanics.
                </p>
                <h2 id="2015">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015)</h2>
                <p>
                    The Witcher 3 is as close to a perfect game as we’re 
                    likely to see in this generation. This is a game that was 
                    so carefully and meticulously crafted, that even its most 
                    forgettable side missions would overshadow the A-plot of 
                    most other RPGs. Even if you’ve read all the books, 
                    you have to admit that not only did the developers nail 
                    these absolutely unforgettable characters in every way, but 
                    they may have even improved upon the source material.
